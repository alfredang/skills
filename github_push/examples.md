## Example Prompts

### Basic Push with Secret Scan
```
User: /github_push

Claude: I'll help you securely push to GitHub!

First, let me scan for any exposed secrets...

Scanning staged files:
- src/app.js
- src/config.js
- package.json

Security scan complete: No secrets detected.

Now let me commit and push your changes...

Commit: feat: add user authentication module
Push: Successfully pushed to origin/main
```

### Push with Secrets Found (Blocked)
```
User: push to github

Claude: I'll help you securely push to GitHub!

First, let me scan for any exposed secrets...

SECURITY ALERT: Secrets detected in staged files!

File: src/config.js:15
  Type: API Key
  Pattern: OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-abc123..."

File: .env:3
  Type: Database URL
  Pattern: DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@...

BLOCKED: Cannot push until secrets are removed.

Remediation:
1. Remove secrets from src/config.js
2. Move credentials to environment variables
3. Add .env to .gitignore
4. Run: git reset HEAD .env
```
