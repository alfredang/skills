./scripts/capture-screenshot.sh [URL]
# Saves to ~/Downloads/linkedin-screenshot.png and opens folder
```

### Method 1: Using Puppeteer (Node.js)
```bash
npx puppeteer screenshot [URL] --output ~/Downloads/linkedin-screenshot.png --viewport 1200x630
```

### Method 2: Using Shot-scraper (Python)
```bash
shot-scraper [URL] -o ~/Downloads/linkedin-screenshot.png --width 1200 --height 630
```

### Method 3: Using Screenshot API
```bash
curl "https://api.screenshotone.com/take?url=[URL]&viewport_width=1200&viewport_height=630&format=png" -o ~/Downloads/linkedin-screenshot.png
```

### Recommended Screenshot Settings
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630px (LinkedIn optimal)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Save location**: ~/Downloads folder
- **Full page**: No, capture viewport only
