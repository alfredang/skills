# Create GitHub README

## Command
`/create_github_readme` or `create_github_readme`

## Navigate
Documentation

## Keywords
readme, github readme, create readme, generate readme, project readme, documentation, readme.md, update readme, write readme, project documentation

## Description
Generate a professional GitHub README.md file for the WSQ Courseware Generator project following open standards and best practices.

## Execution
This skill runs using **Claude Code with subscription plan**. Do NOT use pay-as-you-go API keys. All AI operations should be executed through the Claude Code CLI environment with an active subscription.

## Response
I'll generate a comprehensive GitHub README.md for the project.

The README will include:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Screenshot** | Auto-captured via Playwright MCP (if live site exists) |
| **Header** | Project name, badges, tagline, links |
| **About** | Project description and key features |
| **Tech Stack** | Technologies used with badges |
| **Architecture** | System diagram (ASCII art) |
| **Project Structure** | File/folder organization |
| **Getting Started** | Prerequisites, installation, running |
| **Deployment** | Docker, Hugging Face Spaces instructions |
| **Contributing** | Fork, PR workflow, discussions |
| **Developed By** | Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte. Ltd. |
| **Acknowledgements** | Credits and thanks |

## Instructions
When generating a README, follow this open standard structure:

### 0. Screenshot Capture (Auto)

Before generating the README, check if the project has a live demo URL. If found, use the **Playwright MCP** to capture a screenshot and save it to the project root.

#### 0.1 Detect Live Demo URL

Check these sources in order:
1. User-provided URL
2. `package.json` → `homepage` field
3. Vercel project URL: `https://<project-name>.vercel.app`
4. GitHub Pages URL: `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`
5. Any URL found in an existing README.md

#### 0.2 Capture Screenshot with Playwright MCP

Use the Playwright MCP tools in this sequence:

```
1. browser_navigate → Navigate to the live demo URL
2. browser_wait_for_load_state → Wait for page to fully load (networkidle)
3. browser_screenshot → Take a screenshot and save to project root
```

**Playwright MCP tool calls:**
```
Tool: browser_navigate
Args: { "url": "<LIVE_DEMO_URL>" }

Tool: browser_screenshot
Args: { "name": "screenshot", "savePath": "<PROJECT_ROOT>/screenshot.png" }
```

After capturing, close the browser:
```
Tool: browser_close
```

#### 0.3 Add Screenshot to README

Insert the screenshot after the header section:
```markdown
## Screenshot

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)
```

If the screenshot shows the main UI or hero section, use it. If the page requires authentication or shows a loading state, note this and skip the screenshot.

#### 0.4 If No Live URL Found

Skip screenshot capture and add a commented-out placeholder:
```markdown
## Screenshot

<!-- Add a screenshot of your app here -->
<!-- ![Screenshot](screenshot.png) -->
```

### 1. Header Section
```markdown
<div align="center">

# Project Name

[![Badge1](url)](link)
[![Badge2](url)](link)

**Tagline**

[Demo](url) · [Report Bug](url) · [Request Feature](url)

</div>
```
